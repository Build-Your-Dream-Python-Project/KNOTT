# KnoTT! Bot - Leveling and Leaderboard
## a global leveling bot used in many servers
### This documentation will show you how to invite and use this bot inside of you server

<hr>

# Trust and Safety
## We care about your server's data, we will never leak any kind of data to the public!
### We run the same code that we are publishing on github, the only difference is our bot token that we can't make public because of the Discord ToS and the safety of your data. We also have some additional changes in the code for data encryption, safety of our server and performance but we don't change the main parts of the code, unless it's uploaded to github
